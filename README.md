# game-show-strategy-simulation

The television show, Let's Make a Deal, was created and hosted by Monty Hall in the 1970s. At the finale of a show, Monty would tell the winning contestant that they could pick one of three doors. Behind one door would be a car, but goats were placed behind the other two doors. The contestant picks a door. Now, Monty builds the suspense by opening one of the other doors. Monty knew which door had the car so he'd always reveal one of the goats. He would then tell the contestant that they could change their choice of doors if they wanted. The question is, should the contestant switch or stick with their original choice?

In this project, I simulate the conditional probabilities of the distributions for winning a car versus winning a goat on the Let's Make a Deal television show. I make the case for the best strategy to win the car.
